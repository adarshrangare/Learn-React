## Rules for JSX

- Function which are returning Components and Components File name should start with Capital Letter
- class(Oops) is predefined keyword in react so className is used for class
- varriables are used in jsx with _{....}_
- inside _{....}_ we can write any javascript code which returns varriable.
- in Label _htmlFor_ is used instead of for attribute

```
    <>
     <Component/>
     <button className="button-test" onClick={JS Code}>
        I am Test
     </button>
   </>

```
