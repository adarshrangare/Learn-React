# Introduction
React is a Open-source Frontend Library for Building User Interface created by Facebook(Meta) on May 29th 2013.
- It is Declarative {have to manage states Other work will do Automatically}
- It enhances the performance of Web Apps because it uses Virtual DOM (Compares the Virtual DOM tree and Org JS DOM and only changes Different Nodes)
- Can build both Web and Mobile apps (React DOM and React Native)


    ### FrameWork vs Library
    - Framework provides more functionality but does not provide Flexibility
    - Library is lightweight but provide much Flexibility
    
      **Note:** Whole React EcoSystem (React with other libraries like React Router DOM etc.) feels like a ***Framework***
